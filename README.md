# Mega-Millions-Numbers
Mega-Millions Numbers Generated Using Proprietary Algorithm

The focus on this first part of the system is to guess the first 5 digits of the Mega-Millions using less than 10000 possible sets (There are over 11,000,000 possibilities for the first 5). I will share those numbers before every game in a text file posted here.

The algorithm takes into consideration 23 unique factors and generates the most probable numbers that will be chosen next. I found that the program either fails badly OR does really well guessing 4 or 5 numbers (all minus the Powerball).

I am not looking to sell the program, numbers or a subscription. This is a hobby project of mine and for people who anyway play lotto, especially those using QP, I would suggest you try some of the numbers I post.

I selected to do this on GitHub because once I share a text file here, it will record the date of any changes. This means that I cannot add numbers after the game without you seeing the file having been modified.

Instead of bragging about the program and its abilities, I decided to let the numbers do the talking. Please follow the picks for a while and you will see what I mean.

Thank You
